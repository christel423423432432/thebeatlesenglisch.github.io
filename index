        <p class="u-text u-text-1">The Beatles were the greatest band in the sixties, and still remain popular today.The rock group consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, who was the last one to join the group.All members of the band came from Liverpool in England.Their manager was Brian Epstein.The Beatles met him in Star Clup, in Hamburg.In 1963 they had their first number 1 "please, please."The Bend's last album  was Let It Be. They felt that their individual musical plans were different. <br> Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney are still alive. John Lennon was shot in 1980. George Harrison passed away in 2001. When they died the whole world mourned them because up until that day millions of people had dreamed that  the Beatles would one day be together. back on stage.The Beatles' songs are known all over the  world and have been translated into many different languages, e.g. to Russian. Most of the songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. One of the Beatles' most popular songs, "Yesterday" was released in 1966. Paul McCartney had composed the melody at the piano 3 years earlier. He called the tune "Scrambled Eggs" and initially had the following lyrics: "Scrambled Eggs, oh my baby, how I love your legs, diddle, diddle, I believe in Scrambled Eggs." He woke up one morning and played the tune and suddenly  found the new lyrics to this song: Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away, I believe in yesterday...' etc. <br> Even though the Beatles no longer exist as a band, many Beatles CDs are still sold <br> Last year Paul McCartney gave Concerts in Germany and in some other countries.Tickets sold out quickly.
